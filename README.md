# AirControl-Mini
The smallest open source air conditioner wifi module that works locally without the cloud.

## Features
- **Local Control**: Control AC directly with Home Assistant, ESPHome or MQTT.
- **ESPHome Integration**: Easily integrates with ESPHome for home automation setups.
- **Compact Design**: Small PCB footprint (3.5cm x 2.8cm) suitable for space-constrained installations.
- **Live Reports Support**: Receive live reports and current state from the AC.
- **UART Communication**: Control air conditioner via UART interface.
- **ESPFlash Pin Format**: Programming pin adheres to the [ESPFlash](https://github.com/SuperHouse/ESPFlash) convention.
- **Open-source Hardware and Firmware**: Both the hardware design and the firmware are fully open-source.

------------------

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites:
1. AirControl-Mini.
2. USB-to-serial adapter for programming (optional but highly recommended).
3. A compatible air conditioner that uses one of the supported module.

## ESPhome YAML
The firmware is based on [esphome-panasonic-ac](https://github.com/DomiStyle/esphome-panasonic-ac).

```yaml
esphome:
  name: panasonic-ac
  friendly_name: 
  platform: ESP32
  board: nodemcu-32s

  ssid: !secret wifi_ssid
  password: !secret wifi_password

logger:
  level: DEBUG

# Requires ESPHome 1.15.0+ for the even parity option

    # Enable as needed

    # econavi_switch:

    # nanoex_switch:
    #   name: Panasonic AC NanoeX Switch
    # mild_dry_switch:
    #   name: Panasonic AC Mild Dry Switch
    # current_power_consumption:
    #   name: Panasonic AC Power Consumption

    # Useful when the ac does not report a current temperature (CZ-TACG1 only)
    # current_temperature_sensor: temperature_sensor_id
```

## Setting supported features
Since Panasonic ACs support different features you can comment out the lines at the bottom of your `aircontrol-mini.yaml`:

```
  # Enable as needed
  # eco_switch:
  #   name: Panasonic AC Eco Switch
  # nanoex_switch:
  #   name: Panasonic AC NanoeX Switch
  # mild_dry_switch:
  #   name: Panasonic AC Mild Dry Switch
  # econavi_switch:
  #   name: Econavi switch
  # current_power_consumption:
  #   name: Panasonic AC Power Consumption
```

In order to find out which features are supported by your AC, check the remote that came with it. Please note that eco switch and mild dry switch are not supported on DNSK-P11.

**Enabling unsupported features can lead to undefined behavior and may damage your AC. Make sure to check your remote or manual first.**\
**current_power_consumption is just a ESTIMATED value by the AC**
